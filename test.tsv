Frequency modulation	FM broadcasting usually includes a difference signal, which can cause two different speakers at home to create different sounds.	0
Frequency modulation	This technique is different from amplitude modulation which varies the amplitude, but keeps the frequency constant.	0
Frequency modulation	When transmitting analogue sound, the sound quality of FM signals is better than that of amplitude modulation  signals.	0
Frequency modulation	In the context of broadcasting, Frequency modulation is often shortened to FM.	0
Frequency modulation	However, FM signals do not travel as far as AM beause they use higher frequencies that do not bounce off the Kennelly–Heaviside layer.	0
Frequency modulation	FM signals can be generated using either direct or indirect frequency modulation:	1
Frequency modulation	If formula_25, the modulation is called "wideband FM" and its bandwidth is approximately formula_26.	1
Frequency modulation	For example, 3 kHz deviation modulated by a 2.2 kHz audio tone produces a modulation index of 1.36.	1
Frequency modulation	As the frequency rises and falls the tuned circuit provides a changing amplitude of response, converting FM to AM.	1
Frequency modulation	The system must be designed so that this unwanted output is reduced to an acceptable level.	1

Hormone	Metabolism is all of the chemical and energy reactions that happen in a living thing.	0
Hormone	They do not tell the cells in the body to take up glucose from the blood.	0
Hormone	Such a mechanism depends on factors that influence the metabolism and excretion of hormones.	1
Hormone	Different tissue types may also respond differently to the same hormonal signal.	1
Hormone	These can then be quickly converted into their active hormone form in response to a particular stimulus.	1
Hormone	Thus, higher hormone concentration alone cannot trigger the negative feedback mechanism.	1
Hormone	They knew that the pancreas was involved in the secretion of digestive fluids after the passage of food from the stomach to the intestines, which they believed to be due to the nervous system.	1

Selection sort	When the algorithm first starts, there is no data in the first part as no data has been sorted yet and all the unsorted data is in the second part.	0
Selection sort	It is not an efficient method of sorting data compared to more advanced algorithms such as quicksort and heapsort.	0
Selection sort	The part with the sorted data is then the left-most element and the part with the unsorted data is the remaining unsorted elements.	0
Selection sort	The algorithm repeats itself, by finding the smallest element within the list of unsorted data and swapping it with the left-most element, eventually getting a sorted data.	0
Selection sort	The algorithm then starts to find the smallest item in the unsorted data and swap it with the left-most element of the list.	0
Selection sort	However, insertion sort or selection sort are both typically faster for small arrays .	1
Selection sort	This can be important if writes are significantly more expensive than reads, such as with EEPROM or Flash memory, where every write lessens the lifespan of the memory.	1
Selection sort	Indeed, selection sort does one pass through the remaining items for each item moved.	1
Selection sort	Selection sort is not difficult to analyze compared to other sorting algorithms since none of the loops depend on the data in the array.	1
Selection sort	Even then, considering the number of swaps made, the number of swaps will be n-1 both in worst as well as best case.	1
