Enthalpy	When a chemical reaction happens, a substance can become warmer or colder.	0
Enthalpy	If the pressure stays the same, this amount of heat tells how much the enthalpy changed.	0
Enthalpy	A common standard enthalpy change is the enthalpy of formation, which has been determined for a large number of substances.	1
Enthalpy	Enthalpy itself is a thermodynamic potential, so in order to measure the enthalpy of a system, we must refer to a defined reference point; therefore what we measure is the change in enthalpy, Δ"H".	1
Enthalpy	We apply it to the special case with a constant pressure at the surface.	1
Enthalpy	Change in enthalpy  is the preferred expression of system energy change in many chemical, biological, and physical measurements at constant pressure, because it simplifies the description of energy transfer.	1

Evaporation	The sun  drives evaporation of water from oceans, lakes, moisture in the soil, and other sources of water.	1
Evaporation	When the process of escape and return reaches an equilibrium, the vapor is said to be "saturated", and no further change in either vapor pressure and density or liquid temperature will occur.	1
Evaporation	When a molecule near the surface absorbs enough energy to overcome the vapor pressure, it will escape and enter the surrounding air as a gas.	1

Organelle	While prokaryotes do not possess organelles "per se", some do contain protein-based bacterial microcompartments, which are thought to act as primitive organelles.	1
Organelle	However, even by using this definition, some parts of the cell that have been shown to be distinct functional units do not qualify as organelles.	1

Phoneme	Phonemes are the units of sound  which distinguish one word from another in a particular language, they are discrete abstractions.	0
Phoneme	To learn all the phonemes in English, it would be better to use the IPA, which has a unique letter for every phoneme in English, unlike the English alphabet.	0
Phoneme	As in spoken languages, sign languages have minimal pairs which differ in only one phoneme.	1
Phoneme	The notion of biuniqueness was controversial among some pre-generative linguists and was prominently challenged by Morris Halle and Noam Chomsky in the late 1950s and early 1960s.	1
Phoneme	For example, in most dialects of English, the sound patterns  and  are two separate words that are distinguished by the substitution of one phoneme, , for another phoneme, .	1
Phoneme	Phonemes are conventionally placed between slashes in transcription, whereas speech sounds  are placed between square brackets.	1
Phoneme	In those languages, therefore, the two sounds represent different phonemes.	1

Plasmid	Plasmids can be found in all three major domains, Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya.	0

Plasmid	Plasmids also can provide bacteria with an ability to fix elemental nitrogen or to degrade difficult organic compounds.	0
Plasmid	Plasmid host-to-host transfer requires direct, mechanical transfer by conjugation or changes in host gene expression allowing the intentional uptake of the genetic element by transformation.	0
Plasmid	Rather, plasmids provide a mechanism for horizontal gene transfer within a population of microbes and may provide a selective advantage under a given environmental state.	0
Plasmid	In the complex process of conjugation, plasmid may be transferred from one bacterium to another via sex pili encoded by some of the "tra" genes .	1
Plasmid	Incompatible plasmids  normally share the same replication or partition mechanisms and can thus not be kept together in a single cell.	1
Plasmid	The normal number of copies of plasmid that may be found in a single cell is called the Plasmid copy number, and is determined by how the replication initiation is regulated and the size of the molecule.	1
Plasmid	To clone longer lengths of DNA, lambda phage with lysogeny genes deleted, cosmids, bacterial artificial chromosomes, or yeast artificial chromosomes are used.	1
Plasmid	It is possible to purify certain fragments by cutting the bands out of the gel and dissolving the gel to release the DNA fragments.	1

Sound change	This is why the way English is spelled is so differently from how it is spoken.	0
Sound change	All of these spelling systems have changed little for the past few hundred years, even though their spoken languages sound very different from how they used to sound.	0
Sound change	An example of a sound change in English is the Great Vowel Shift, when all of the long vowel sounds in Middle English changed into what they are today.	0
Sound change	Because of this, it is natural for languages to sound differently overtime.	0
Sound change	Since people of different languages or dialects often talk to each other, the way people talk becomes more like the way the others talk.	0
Sound change	Sound changes that affect a whole phonological system are also classified according to how they affect the overall shape of the system; see "phonological change".	1
Sound change	Sound change that affects the phonological system, in the number or distribution of its phonemes, is covered more fully at phonological change.	1
Sound change	Sound change is exceptionless: if a sound change can happen at a place, it will.	1
Sound change	The example above is actually a compressed account of a "sequence" of changes; *t changed first into a voiceless dental fricative , which has yielded present-day [f].	1
Sound change	Also, sound changes may be regularized in inflectional paradigms , in which case the change is no longer phonological but morphological in nature.	1

Space colonization	Some national space programs see space colonization as a long-term goal.	0
Space colonization	This means changing a body's atmosphere, temperature, surface topography or ecology to be similar to the biosphere of Earth, so that humans can live there.	0
Space colonization	Mars is the most Earth-like planet known, so the colonization of Mars may be first.	0
Space colonization	Resources, such as solar energy and water, are available from or on the Moon, Mars, near-Earth asteroids or other planetary bodies.	0
Space colonization	However, many people have put forward ideas and thought about the first space colony.	0
Space colonization	Moreover, lack of sleep, fatigue, and work overload can affect an astronaut's ability to perform well in an environment such as space where every action is critical.	1
Space colonization	This can lead to exhaustion, as well as other sleep problems such as insomnia, which can reduce their productivity and lead to mental health disorders.	1
Space colonization	In 2005, then NASA Administrator Michael Griffin identified space colonization as the ultimate goal of current spaceflight programs, saying:	1
Space colonization	Flat mirrors to reflect sunlight around radiation shields into living areas  or onto crops are even lighter and easier to build.	1
Space colonization	Launching materials from Earth is expensive, so bulk materials for colonies could come from the Moon, a near-Earth object , Phobos, or Deimos.	1
Speciation	All of the native drosophilid species in Hawaii have apparently descended from "a single ancestral species" that colonized the islands, about 20 million years ago.	0
Speciation	Isolating mechanisms are things which prevent successful breeding between groups in a species.	0
Speciation	Such non-breeding-though-genetically-connected 'end' populations may co-exist in the same region, thus closing a 'ring'.	0
Speciation	In sympatric speciation, species diverge while inhabiting the same place.	0
Speciation	The range of these gulls forms a ring around the North Pole, which is not normally flown over by individual gulls.	0
Speciation	Reinforcement may be induced in artificial selection experiments as described below.	1
Speciation	Ecologists refer to parapatric and peripatric speciation in terms of ecological niches.	1
Speciation	Without reinforcement, the geographic area of contact between different forms of the same species, called their "hybrid zone," will not develop into a boundary between the different species.	1
Speciation	The resolution to Darwin's second dilemma might thus come about as follows:	1
Speciation	Whether genetic drift is a minor or major contributor to speciation is the subject matter of much ongoing discussion.	1

Squirrel	The native Old English word for the squirrel, "ācweorna", survived only into Middle English  before being replaced.	1
Squirrel	Squirrels live in almost every habitat, from tropical rainforest to semiarid desert, avoiding only the high polar regions and the driest of deserts.	1
Squirrel	Apart from these sometimes little-known fossil forms, the phylogeny of the living squirrels is fairly straightforward.	1
